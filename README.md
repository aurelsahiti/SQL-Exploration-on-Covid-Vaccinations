# SQL Project: Global COVID-19 Analysis  

**Prepared by Aurel Sahiti**  

---

## üß≠ Project Overview
This project explores **global COVID-19 trends** using **SQL (Google BigQuery)**.  
It focuses on analyzing infection, mortality, and vaccination rates by country and continent to derive **data-driven insights about pandemic impact and vaccine distribution**.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Explore how infection and death rates differ across countries and continents.  
- Quantify the **likelihood of dying** from COVID-19 (case fatality rate).  
- Measure the **percentage of population infected** over time.  
- Examine global **vaccination progress** and population coverage.  
- Build reusable SQL views and tables for downstream visualization (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).
